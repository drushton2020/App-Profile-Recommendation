    "From exploring the data - I have found that there is many apps that do not have englsh names. I want to analyze the data of apps that are directed toward english-speakiing audiences. Therefore, I am not interested in keeping these apps and will remove them. \n",

    "The numbers corresponding to the characters we commonly use in an English text are all in the range 0 - 127. Using this, then we can build a function that detects whether a character belongs to the set of common english characters or not. "

    "This niche seems to be dominated by software for processing and reading ebooks, as well as various collections of libraries and dictionaries, so it's probably not a good idea to build similar apps since there'll be some significant competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also notice there are quite a few apps built around the book Quran, which suggests that building an app around a popular book can be profitable. It seems that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it looks like the market is already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.\n",

    "We concluded that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets.
